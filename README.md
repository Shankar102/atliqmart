AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.


# Objective

Generate Insights to solve a supply chain Issue in the FMCG domain.

# Task 

As a data analyst in the supply chain team I joined AtliQ Mart recently. He has been briefed about the the task in the stakeholder business review meeting.  The new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

# KeyMatrix 

➜ OT % - On time delivery percentage

➜ IF % - In Full delivery percentage

➜ OTIF % - On time and In Full delivery percentage

➜ LIFR - Line Fill Rate

➜ VOFR - Volume Fill Rate


Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in comic form. Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.

# Conclution

•	All the Key Metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are far behind the target

•	On an average, orders are delayed 0.42 days from the agreed date of delivery

•	Lotus Mart, Coolblue, Acclaimed stores have the highest orders as well as delayed the most to deliver the products on time

o	Is it because we are not estimating the right delivery date?

o	Is it because we are receiving more orders than expected?

•	Ghee, curd and butter products are most delayed to deliver.

•	There is no noticeable improvements in any of the key metrics in the last few months

•	There is a huge gap in IF% for most of the customers. Is it because of less production?
